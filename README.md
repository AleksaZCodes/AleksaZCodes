## 🚀 About Me

I'm enthusiastic about learning and building innovative solutions. In my spare time, I train karate, indulge in physics, and enjoy amateur astrophotography and drone videography.

I also love robotics, thinkering and engineering in general, neuroscience, and plants (_especially unusual species like **Mimosa Pudica**_).

Feel free to check out my repositories and connect with me!
